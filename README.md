# World Cup
This project was created as a glimpse of the World Cup over the years. I wanted to look at the amount of games played by each team, performance of each team based on average goals per game, team records over the years, and finally a breakdown of the Champions. I initially created the project to improve my use of different chart types in Tableau, but decided to also use it to test/further my SQL skills.
