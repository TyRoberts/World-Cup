# World Cup
#### This project was created as a glimpse of the World Cup over the years. I wanted to look at the amount of games played by each team, performance of each team based on average goals per game, team records over the years, and finally a breakdown of the Champions. I initially created the project to improve my use of different chart types in Tableau, but decided to also use it to test/further my SQL skills. 
#### For the most part the queries were easy, using only some aggregation and filtering. For the games played query I chose to use a CTE for better readability, but it still didn't require anything too intense. The only struggle came when I was writing the query for the Win Loss History, querying the record with a running total was arduous. I was able to write a query that returned the correct results quickly but felt the query was sloppy and hard to read. After a lot of research and many failed attempts to clean up the query I reasoned that, with a comment, what I had would suffice.
#### Overall I think this project was a success, I was learned a few new SQL tricks, mainly how to create a running total, and was able to create a nice visual, (check it out at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyrell.roberts/viz/WorldCup_16566341998790/FIFA). I anticipate using the SQL knowledge and the understanding that sometimes getting the correct answer is good enough in future projects .
